# PantserWriter Beta
**PLEASE LOOK BELOW AT KNOWN BUGS BEFORE USING**

Supported platform(s): **Windows 10**

Why use this software?

**Here are some of PantserWriter's unique features that you may like:**
  1. The **integrated note-taking companion with an intuitive and unobtrusive design** allows you to manage and edit notes on the fly without disrupting your workflow.
  2. **Any note that you create can easily be used as a template** for other notes. Do you have a preferred format for character profiles? Just create an empty character profile once, then use it as a template for all of your characters! You can use these templates in all of your PantserWriter projects as well; just copy the folder containing your templates into the "notes" folder of the desired project. (see unavailable feature #8 for details during beta)
  3. PantserWriter **projects use your computer's default directory/file system, and every file is simply a .rtf file**, so you can open and edit them in most word processors. This also means that if you decide you don't like PantserWriter, it will take virtually no work to move to another word processor.
  4. **Blazing fast workflow** using mostly-common hotkeys. You won't ever have to take your hands off the keyboard while inside the application. Feel the freedom and stay in the zone of writing!
  5. It's **completely free**.

**Some features that are currently unavailable:**
  1. Backup a project to another directory/folder from within the application
  2. Open another project after already opening one; you will have to exit the program to open a different project
  3. Keyword search within the body of a file
  4. Combining the chapters within the manuscript folder in order to create one manuscript document (you could just use a single file if this is an issue)
  5. Creating a sequel project that automatically imports all of your notes from the original project within the application
  6. Spellcheck
  7. Numbered lists
  8. Manual syncing using the application's user interface (if you added a folder or file to your project while the application was running, you will have to restart the application to see them in the user interface)

**Just download and extract the .zip file.**

**Known Bugs**
  1. When switching files, the file that you are switching from will occasionally overwrite the file you are switching to (happens with note files and chapter files).

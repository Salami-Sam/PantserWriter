Supported platform(s): **Windows 10**

Why use this software?

**Here are some of PantserWriter's unique features that you may like:**
  1. The [**integrated note-taking companion with an intuitive and unobtrusive design**] allows you to manage and edit notes on the fly without disrupting your workflow.
  2. Right click any word or phrase in your manuscript and a context menu will appear with a list of all of your notes whose names closely resembles the word/phrase so that you can **[open your notes without having to search for them]**.
  3. **[Any note that you create can easily be used as a template]** for other notes. Do you have a preferred format for character profiles? Just create an empty character profile once, then use it as a template for all of your characters! You can use these templates in all of your PantserWriter projects as well; just copy the folder containing your templates into the "notes" folder of the desired project. (see unavailable feature #8 for details during beta)
  4. PantserWriter **[projects use your computer's default directory/file system, and every file is simply a .rtf file]**, so you can open and edit them in most word processors. This also means that if you decide you don't like PantserWriter, it will take virtually no work to move to another word processor.
  5. **[Blazing fast workflow]** using mostly-common hotkeys. You won't ever have to take your hands off the keyboard while inside the application. Feel the freedom and stay in the zone of writing! (Some hotkeys may not be implemented during beta.)
  6. It's **[completely free]**.

**About this project**

  I am a hobbiest fiction writer who is a currently a full-time student in a computer science progam. I am a proud pantser (or gardener, or whatever term you prefer), but I get bogged down in having to constantly open and close different note files to keep track of everything as I draft. I wanted a word processor that would allow me to open note files based on keywords in my manuscript so that I wouldn't have to keep searching through a file system or balancing two big documents on my screen at the same time. Notion and Bibisco both came close for me (check those out by the way), but I still wasn't satisfied. So besides this being a resume-building project for me, it's also aimed to be the writing software of my dreams. If you are a writer that hates outlining/plotting/planning but often struggles to keep track of things (like characters, locations, lore, magic rules, etc) in your story as it gets bigger and bigger, you might want to give PantserWriter a try.

**Some features that are currently unavailable but are planned for the full version:**
  1. Backup a project to another directory/folder from within the application
  2. Open another project after already opening one; you will have to exit the program to open a different project
  3. Keyword search within the body of a file **Update 11/27/2020:** You can now open a note based on right clicking on a keyword in your manuscript's body.
  4. Combining the chapters within the manuscript folder in order to create one manuscript document (you could just use a single file if this is an issue)
  5. Creating a sequel project that automatically imports all of your notes from the original project within the application
  6. Spellcheck
  7. Numbered lists
  8. Manual file syncing with the application's user interface (if you added a folder or file to your project while the application was running, you will have to restart the application to see them in the user interface)
  9. Underline text

**Just download and extract the .zip file.**

**Known Bugs**
  1. Word count is off by +/- 1 word.
  2. When holding Ctrl + Z to undo, the cursor gets out of place and not everything is able to be undone that should be.
  3. A Windows sound plays when using Ctrl + Shift + Z to open keyword context menu, but not when using right click on the mouse.

**Fixed Bugs**
  1. **FIXED (11/25/2020):** When switching files, the file that you are switching from will occasionally overwrite the file you are switching to (happens with note files and chapter files).
  2. **FIXED (11/25/2020):** Current note's content would not update when deleting a note.
  3. **FIXED (11/27/2020):** Undo no longer just deletes everything you have written.

**Updates**
  1. **11/25/2020:** Changed how zooming works. You can now use Ctrl + scrollwheel to zoom in and out freely and the application will remember your zoom settings. No manual typing option exists right now for zooming.  Overall workflow/usability improvements have been made.
  2. **11/27/2020** You can now right click on a word to see if it matches the name of your notes. A context menu will appear with every note whose name is closely matched so that you can click on one to open in a new (bare bones) note companion to edit. For example, say you are writting about a man named John. You reveal something new about his character and now you want to add that new info to his character sheet in your notes. Just right click on his name and you can directly access it from the context menu, no searching needed.

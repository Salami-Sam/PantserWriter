# PantserWriter Beta Release
The official beta release for my word processor and note taking software geared toward writers like me who hate outlining.

Some features that are currently unavailable:
  1. Backup a project to another directory/folder from within the application
  2. Open another project after already opening one; you will have to exit the program to open a different project
  3. Keyword searches within the body of the note and manuscript files are unsupported
  4. Combining the chapters within the manuscript folder in order to create one manuscript document (you could just use a single file if this is an issue)
  5. Creating a sequel project that automatically imports all of your notes from the original project within the application

Just download and extract the .zip file.
